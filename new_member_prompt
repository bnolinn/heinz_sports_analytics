Prompt 1: Find the 5 players with the highest eFG% and the 5 players with the lowest eFG%
eFG% = (Field Goals Made + (0.5 * 3-Point Field Goals Made)) / (Field Goal Attempts)


Prompt 2: Find the 5 players with the highest defensive efficiency and the 5 players with the lowest defensive efficiency
Defensive Efficiency = (Steals + Blocks + Defensive Rebounds) / Minutes Played


Prompt 3A: You have been hired as a consultant for an NBA team. They’ve tasked you with building a lineup of undervalued players. First, use the overall efficiency formula below to evaluate players and find the ten best players in terms of overall efficiency. The players must have no more than 20 minutes played per game. Average the ‘minutes’ column for each player over the whole season to find their average minutes per game.
Overall Efficiency (weighted) = [(Points × 1.0) + (Rebounds × 1.2) + (Assists × 1.5) + (Steals × 2.0) + (Blocks × 2.0)] / Minutes Played

Prompt 3B: Next, create a starting lineup of undervalued players. Use overall efficiency or any other metrics you desire to build the lineup. The players must have no more than 20 minutes played per game in the minutes category.

Your starting lineup should include:
Guard (guard/point guard/shooting guard)
Guard (guard/point guard/shooting guard)
Forward (forward/small forward/ power forward)
Forward (forward/small forward/ power forward)
Center
